 @protocol PenToolControllerDelegate
 @brief The delegate of a PenToolController object must adopt the PenToolControllerDelegate protocol.
 @discussion PenToolControllerDelegate Protocol used to handle all the callbacks of PenToolController Class. All delegate methods are optional.The PenToolControllerDelegate protocol defines methods that allow user to perform actions when any drawing is created, updated or deleted by the user. Also when undoable status of pentool gets updated.
 
 When configuring the PenToolController object, assign your delegate object to its delegate property.
