 @protocol MyDataControllerDelegate
 @brief The delegate of a MyDataController object must adopt the MyDataControllerDelegate protocol.
 @discussion MyDataControllerDelegate Protocol used to handle all the callbacks of MyDataController Class. The MyDataControllerDelegate protocol defines methods that allow user to perform action when any segment is tapped i.e. Highlights and notes or any data row from the segment is tapped by the user. All Delegate methods are optional. When configuring the MyDataController object, assign your delegate object to its delegate property.
